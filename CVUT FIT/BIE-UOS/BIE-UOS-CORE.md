Content:
Unix (20%) + shell(25%) + commands(50%) + programming(5%)

This module is mainly practical. It is necessary to remember some theory, but it is usually around 60% practice.

In case you only have the Windows operating system, you may install a UNIX terminal without switching your OS. 
`fray1.fit.cvut.cz` is a server every student has access to, and may connect using the Secure Shell protocol. The server runs the Solaris operating system on Intel processor. You may use it to practice the shell.
The student may log in from any system using an **ssh client** (puTTY for older versions, `ssh` command for Windows 10 or newer). 

Alternatively, the student may use vitalization software (VMware, VirtualBox) and create a virtual machine and install the appropriate OS on it. 

There is also the possibility of installing different OS's in different partitions of the disk. When starting the computer, we can choose which OS we want to boot. (Dual Booting)
