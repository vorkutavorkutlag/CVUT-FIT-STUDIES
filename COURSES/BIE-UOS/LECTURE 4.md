The only important thing that happened was doing exercise with previous lecture's information, also using scp command in the ssh protocol to copy over a bash script we wrote in our local computer over to the fray server. 
```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "Script is called \"$0\""
echo "I am writing on \"$HOSTNAME\""
echo "Under the name of \"$USER\""
```
