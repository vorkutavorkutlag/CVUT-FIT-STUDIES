## Data Structure

What is the data structure, how does it relate to a structure, and what is the difference?

A data structure is usually a blackbox container that store data in a specific way and let us access it in that way. For example, a linked list is a data structure, whereas a TSTUDENT is just a structure.

BFS and DFS are algorithms/guideline to develop an algorithm that solves problems akin to mazes.

Efficient searching in a set could be implemented. For instance, binary searching is efficient, but not the best. Maybe hash table or trees. We do not care about the order of elements in a set, not about the position in the structure, rather only if an element is there or not.
A map (dictionary) can be seen as a set where each element, a key, is associated with some other data. A key may be either present, and have a data, or it is not present, at which point we can add a new key and associate it with that.


TL;DR a bunch of nothing and a double ended queue.
