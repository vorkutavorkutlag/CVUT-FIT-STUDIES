We exercised in such a way that given a system of linear equations, we convert them into an augmented matrix and enact row operations on it through Gaussian elimination to get a 'staircase', at the end of which we find if there are:
- Free variables (all columns have pivots, so no free variables).
- Amount of solutions (We have no rows $[0 0 0 0 | b]$ so it has at least one solution)
