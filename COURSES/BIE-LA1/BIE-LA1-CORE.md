[[COURSES/BIE-LA1/LECTURE 1|LECTURE 1]]

Tutorials will consist of either computations, or true or false tasks. For computations you must explain everything step by step and explain which part of the theory is being used. Lack of sufficient proof will results in no credits being given.
Main recommended book: Introduction to linear and matrix algebras by N. Johnston & Linear algebra done wrong by Triell.
It is recommended to look at the lecture slides and tutorials first, and attempt to grasp those before you attempt reading the books.
