[[LECTURE 22 (TUTORIAL)]]

A vector space is spanning if it admits a spanning list. As in, if there exists a list that spans it.
A matrix is invertible $\iff$ SLE $Ax=b$ has a unique solution for any $x, b$ in the field.
If in the REF form of $A$ it has a pivot in every column, it is LI. 
(pivot in every row == spanning)
A unique solution implies a pivot in every row and column.
