Solving for if a vector is in the span of other vectors. (SLE, GEM, REF) If SLE is consistent then it is in the span.
Solving if a set of vectors is linearly independent.
If a linear combination of the vectors is equal to $\vec0$ then the scalars are all equal to zero. If SLE has a unique solution (all pivots) then LI.
