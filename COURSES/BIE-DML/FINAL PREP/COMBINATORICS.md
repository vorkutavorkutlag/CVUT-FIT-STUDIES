When counting objects, there are several ways to count them.
If you care about the order, if you care about repetition...

In this section we will always assume that we are selecting $k$ elements from a set containing $n$ distinct elements if not said otherwise. Recall that $n \geq k$ is not necessary

__Permutation__ 
$k=n$, order matters. Permutation with no repetition.
Formula: $n!$ 

**Variations without repetition**
elements in the selection cannot be repeated and order matters.
Formula: $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ 
Not to be confused with ${n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

__Variations with repetition__
elements in the selection can be repeated and order matters
Formula: $n^k$

__Combinations without repetition__ 
elements in the selection cannot be repeated and order does not matter.
Choosing!
Formula: ${n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

__Combinations with repetition__
elements in the selection can be repeated and order does not matter.
Formula: ${n+k-1 \choose k}$  

__Permutations with repetition__
If we are selecting from an n-element set which contains $n_1$ identical items of type 1, $n_2$ identical items of type 2, . . . , and $n_k$ identical items of type k. Like colors!
Formula: $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}$

Goodness God Lord This Is Hopeless.
