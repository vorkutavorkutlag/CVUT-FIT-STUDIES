__Cardinality of Sets__
Consider two sets A, B. 
An injection from A to B implies $|A| \leq |B|$.
A surjection from A to B implies $|B| \leq A$.
A bijection from A to B implies $|A| = |B|$.

If a set is finite, then its cardinality is the number of elements in it.
If a set is infinite, then:
- If it's countable: $|A| = |N| = \aleph_0$  
- It is uncountable: ... uncountable.

The ability to index grants us countability.
The interval of real numbers between 0, 1 always has a number between them, so it is not countable.

By theorem, 
$|A| < |P(A)|$ for every set $A$
$|B^A|=|B|^{|A|}$ for every finite sets $A, B$.
$|P(A) = |{0,1}^A|$. In particular, if A is finite, $|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}$.

Comparing cardinalities follows intuitive rules.

CNF and DNF complete each other, the negations of the missing min/max-terms are the ones corresponding to the opposite form.
